# üé® Painterly ‚Äî Bridging Manual Art & AI Generation

## üéØ Project Summary

### The Challenge
In game development and 3D visualization, we face a critical challenge:
- Hand-painted "2.5D" textures create beautiful, stylized results but are extremely time-consuming
- Current AI solutions attempt to automate this but often produce inconsistent or unpredictable results
- Artists need a middle ground that combines the control of manual painting with the efficiency of automation

### Our Solution
Painterly is an innovative Blender add-on that bridges this gap by:
- Algorithmically replicating the hand-painting process
- Providing artist-friendly controls for consistent style
- Maintaining the efficiency of automated solutions

### Technical Approach
Our solution combines several advanced techniques:
- **Brush Stroke Analysis**: Developed algorithms for natural brush stroke generation and placement
- **Contour-Guided System**: Uses mesh geometry and normal maps to guide stroke direction and density
- **UV-Space Optimization**: Intelligent handling of UV space for consistent texture density
- **Normal Map Enhancement**: Custom normal map generation for enhanced depth and detail

### Key Technical Features
1. **Smart Stroke Generation**
   - Intelligent stroke placement based on surface features
   - Customizable stroke parameters (width, length, angle, color variation)

2. **Advanced Texture Processing**
   - Multi-layer texture handling
   - Automatic UV space analysis
   - Edge detection and preservation
   - Normal map generation and enhancement

We've created a sweet spot between fully manual texture painting and completely automated AI generation, giving artists the best of both worlds.

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Installation
1. Clone repository and zip /painterly directory OR download painterly.zip
2. In Blender:
   - Navigate to Edit > Preferences > Add-ons
   - Click "Install" and select the downloaded `painterly.zip`
   - Enable "Painterly" in the add-ons list
3. Access Painterly in the N-panel (press N)

### Quick Start Guide
1. Open Blender (from command line is recommended for progress logs)
2. Select your 3D model
3. Open Painterly panel (N-panel)
4. Choose a preset or adjust parameters
5. Click "Apply" to generate effect
6. In Shading tab, create normal map + Image texture blocks and connect to Principle BSDF (or replace existing normal map with generated map)
7. Fine-tune as needed

## ‚öôÔ∏è Parameter Guide
